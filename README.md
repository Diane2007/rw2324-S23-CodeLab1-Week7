# TRIFLES: A PROTOTYPE

PLEASE PLAY IN FULL SCREEN

The game is based on a 1916 stageplay by Susan Glaspell, where player navigates in the crime scene to figure out who killed John Wright and why. The main interaction is pretty much done, and I wrote a basic dialogue system (but unfortunately had to use the blasphemy of CoRoutine...)

The UI can be better, but since this is a prototype, I'm not that concerned...
